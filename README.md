# incwo ERP Android

This is the source code and assets for the iOS version of ERP application from [incwo](https://www.incwo.com).

## Building the project

The project should build with the latest version of Android Studio.

For bug reports, we use Firebase and Crashlytics. For confiditiality reasons, the `google-services.json` file — which contains our credentials for these services — is not commited into this repo. You may either 

* remove both dependencies in your Gradle files 
* or open your own account on Firebase and provide your own `google-services.json`.
